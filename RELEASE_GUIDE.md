## Git Workflow

### 1. Branches

- `main`: Stable, production-ready code. Tags are created here.
- `next`: Integration branch for ongoing development.
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches.
- `release/*`: For preparing a release.
- `hotfix/*`: Critical fixes, directly from main.

### 2. Tags

- Tags are created only on main after merging release or hotfix branches.

### 3. Branch Workflows

- **next branch**:
  - All ongoing development and feature merges happen on the next branch.
  - After merging hotfix or release to the main branch, we need to merge the main branch to the next branch.

- **main branch**:
  - The main branch is used to create the tag and create the hotfix branch.

- **Release Workflow**:
  - Prepare releases on `release/*` from `next`, merge into `main`, create a tag, and then merge `main` to `next`.

- **Hotfix Workflow**:
  - Critical fixes start from `main`, are fixed on `hotfix/*`, merged back to `main` (with tags), and then merge `main` to `next`.

## Version Strategy

We follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** for our version strategy, which uses the format **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**:

- **MAJOR** version increments when making incompatible changes.
- **MINOR** version increments when adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH** version increments when making backward-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** format.

[Reference link](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver)

**Example:**
`1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0`

### Breaking Changes

When introducing breaking changes, include a ! after the commit type.

### Example

```bash
git commit -m "feat!: change authentication method"
```

## Version Dependency Management

### Overview

The version.json file serves as a central metadata file to define the versioning and dependencies of a service. It ensures compatibility checks can be automated in CI/CD pipelines and provides clear documentation for integrators about which service versions work together.

### Example Structure

```bash
// version.json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "apiVersion": "1.0.0",
  "docVersion": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "vckit": {
      "repoUrl": "https://github.com/uncefact/project-vckit.git",
      "versions": ["1.0.0", "1.0.1", "1.0.2"]
    },
    "storage-service": {
      "repoUrl": "https://github.com/uncefact/project-identity-resolver.git",
      "versions": ["1.0.0", "1.0.1", "1.0.2"]
    },
    "idr": {
      "repoUrl": "https://github.com/pyx-industries/pyx-identity-resolver.git",
      "versions": ["1.0.0", "1.0.1", "1.0.2"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Fields

- `version`: The version of the current service. Must align with the Git tag.
- `apiVersion`: The API version exposed by the service, the field is optional.
- `docVersion`: The version of the documentation.
- `dependencies`: A list of dependent services with their repositories and compatible version list, the field is optional.
- `repoUrl`: URL of the repository for the dependent service.
- `versions`: Specifies compatible versions.

### Rules

1. **Version Update**:
   - Update the `version.json` file whenever preparing a release.
   - Ensure that the version field matches the Git tag of the release.

2. **Dependency Validation**:
   - Validate the listed versions or ranges in the dependencies field.
   - Confirm compatibility through integration tests for all specified versions.

3. **Semantic Versioning**:
   - Follow semantic versioning guidelines.

4. **Automation**:
   - Automate the validation of dependencies using CI/CD pipelines to fetch tags from repositories and validate their existence.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Ensure `version.json` is accessible to developers and integrators.
   - Document any changes in version compatibility in release notes.
