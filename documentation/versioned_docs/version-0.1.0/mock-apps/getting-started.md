Within the Getting Started section we will focus on the following topics:

1. [**Installing Dependencies**](/docs/mock-apps/installation): Learn how to install the necessary dependencies required to run the mock apps.

2. [**Required Services and Documentation**](/docs/mock-apps/dependent-services/): Gain an understanding of the various services that play a crucial role in the functioning of the mock apps. We will provide an overview of each service, explain its significance within the UNTP ecosystem, and provide links and references to the relevant documentation sources. This will make it easy for you to access in-depth information about each service and how to get each service set-up.

3. [**Mock App Configuration File**](/docs/mock-apps/configuration/): Get acquainted with the mock app configuration file. We will provide an overview of the configuration options available and guide you on how to customise the mock apps to suit your specific requirements.

By the end of this section, you will have a solid foundation for installing and configuring the mock apps. You will understand the dependencies required, the role of each service, where to find additional documentation, and how to configure the mock apps using the configuration file.
