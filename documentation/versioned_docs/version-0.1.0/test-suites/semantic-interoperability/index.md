The [United Nations Transparency Protocol (UNTP)](https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/) Semantic Interoperability Test Suite is a vital tool for implementers working on UNTP implementations and extensions. This comprehensive suite, designed for the second tier of UNTP testing, enables implementers to:

1. Verify their implementations' conformance to core UNTP credential data models, including Digital Product Passports, Digital Conformity Credentials, Digital Traceability Events, and Digital Identity Credentials.

2. Develop and validate UNTP credential extensions whilst ensuring adherence to the core data model.

By utilising this test suite, implementers can ensure their implementations and extensions align with the core UNTP data model, facilitating seamless integration within the UNTP ecosystem.

## Key Features and Benefits:

1. **Comprehensive Conformance Testing**:
   Ensures implementers' adherence to core UNTP credential data models, promoting standardisation across the UNTP ecosystem.

2. **Extension Development Support**:
   Facilitates the creation of UNTP credential extensions whilst maintaining compatibility with the core data model.

3. **Dual Interface Flexibility**:
   Offers both CLI and Library interfaces, catering to various development workflows and integration requirements.

4. **Cross-Actor Compatibility**:
   Promotes interoperability among different UNTP actors by ensuring conformance to a common data model.

5. **Rapid Validation**:
   Enables quick verification of UNTP credentials against the core data model, streamlining the development and testing process.

6. **Prototype Testing**:
   Ideal for credential development, allowing implementers to prototype and test extensions to the UNTP protocol in a controlled environment.
