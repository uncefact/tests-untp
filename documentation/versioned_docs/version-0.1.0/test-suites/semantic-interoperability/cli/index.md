The [United Nations Transparency Protocol (UNTP)](https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/) Semantic Interoperability Test Suite CLI is a powerful tool designed for rapid validation of credentials produced by UNTP implementers and implementations. This suite ensures that the credentials comply with the core UNTP data model, making it an essential resource for developers, organisations and communities working with the UNTP protocol.

## Key Features

- **Rapid Validation**: Quickly verify the compliance of UNTP credentials with the core data model.
- **Prototype Testing**: Ideal for credential development, allowing you to prototype and test extensions to the UNTP protocol.
- **Flexibility**: Suitable for both implementation testing and exploratory development.

By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of how to install, configure and use the CLI to validate UNTP credentials. You will be familiar with the configuration file structure, available commands and how to test your extensions against the core UNTP data model.
