The Getting Started section covers the following topics for each:

1. [**Installation**](/docs/test-suites/semantic-interoperability/cli/installation): Learn how to install the necessary dependencies and set up the Tier 2 test suite on your system.

2. [**Configuration**](/docs/test-suites/semantic-interoperability/cli/configuration): Understand how to configure the test suite. We'll cover the structure of the configuration file, how to specify credential types and versions, and how to reference your test credential files.

3. [**Usage**](/docs/test-suites/semantic-interoperability/cli/usage): Learn how to run the test suite, interpret the results. This section will guide you through validating your UNTP credentials against the core data model.

4. [**Extending the Test Suite**](/docs/test-suites/semantic-interoperability/cli/extensions): Discover how to extend the test suite to accommodate custom credential types or additional properties. This section will be particularly useful if you're prototyping extensions to the UNTP protocol.

By the end of this section, you will have a solid foundation for installing, configuring, and using the UNTP Semantic Interoperability Tier 2 Test Suite. You'll be able to validate your UNTP credentials against the core data model and explore extending the test suite for your specific use cases.
