## Overview

Transparency Graphs are a key component of the UNTP ecosystem, providing a mechanism to verify the contextual scope of linked credentials and create a comprehensive view of a product's ESG footprint throughout its value chain.

Key aspects of Transparency Graphs include:

1. **Linked Credentials**: Assessing bundles of linked credentials drawn from all or part of a value chain.
2. **Contextual Verification**: Verifying the context of related credentials to prevent fraudulent or mismatched attestations.
3. **UNTP Core Vocabulary**: Utilizing uniquely identified linked data entities such as Product, Location, Facility, Party, Standard, Regulation, Criteria, Declaration, Attestation, and Endorsement.

Transparency Graphs enable the construction of Digital Product Passports and Digital Conformity Credentials, allowing for a comprehensive and verifiable representation of a product's journey and characteristics.
