<Disclaimer />

To test your Verifiable Credential implementation:

1. Access the [W3C V2 VCDM Test Suite](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model-2.0-test-suite).
2. Follow the instructions provided in the test suite repository to set up and run the tests.
3. Ensure that your implementation passes all relevant tests (TBA).

For more information about the W3C V2 VCDM specification, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/).

Please note that while passing these tests is necessary for UNTP compliance, it may not be sufficient. Refer to the [Verifiable Credential section](https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/docs/specification/VerifiableCredentials) of the UNTP specification for additional UNTP-specific requirements.
