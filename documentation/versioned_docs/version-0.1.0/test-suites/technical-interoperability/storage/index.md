## Overview

The Storage component of the UNTP ecosystem ensures that credentials and related data are securely stored and easily retrievable. This section covers the testing procedures for implementing storage solutions that are compatible with the UNTP protocol.

Key aspects of the storage system that will be tested include:

1. Data security and encryption
2. Accessibility and retrieval mechanisms

Proper implementation and testing of the Storage component are crucial for maintaining the security, integrity, and accessibility of credentials within the UNTP system.

For specific testing procedures, please refer to the [Testing](./testing) page.
