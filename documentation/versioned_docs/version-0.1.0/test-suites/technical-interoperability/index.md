The [United Nations Transparency Protocol (UNTP)](https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/) Technical Interoperability test suite ensures that implementations of the UNTP protocol meet the required standards for interoperability. This suite comprises both internal tests developed by the UNTP community and external tests created by other communities.

The test suite covers five main areas:

1. [Verifiable Credential Interoperability](./verifiable-credentials)
2. [UNTP-specific Extensions](./untp-extensions)
3. [Identity Resolution (IDR)](./identity-resolution)
4. [Storage](./storage)
5. [Transparency Graphs](./transparency-graphs)

Each section of the test suite focuses on different aspects of the UNTP implementation, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all technical interoperability requirements. Please refer to the individual sections for more detailed information and testing procedures.
