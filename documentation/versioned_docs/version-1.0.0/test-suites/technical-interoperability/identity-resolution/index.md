## Overview

The Identity Resolution (IDR) component of the UNTP ecosystem ensures that identifiers used within the system are properly managed, resolved, and interoperable. This includes:

- Data carriers (e.g., barcodes, QR codes, RFID tags)
- Identifier structure
- IDR ISO compliance

Proper implementation of IDR is crucial for maintaining the integrity and traceability of products and entities within the UNTP system.

For testing procedures, please refer to the [Testing](./testing) page.
