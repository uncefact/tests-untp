## Overview

The [Verifiable Credentials (VC)](https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/docs/specification/VerifiableCredentials) interoperability tests focus on ensuring that your implementation produces valid credentials conforming to the [W3C V2 Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/).

This section utilises an [external test suite](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model-2.0-test-suite) developed by the W3C community. The primary goal is to verify that the VCs produced by your system are compliant with the VCDM specification and can be correctly interpreted by other systems implementing the same standard.

For detailed testing procedures, please refer to the [Testing](./testing) page.
